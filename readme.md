![LOGO](/assets/icon-80.png)


## 🚀 Overview  
SafeMail Agent is an AI-powered Chrome extension designed to **analyze incoming emails, extract key compliance-related actions, and automate security processes**. It scans emails in real-time, identifies regulatory requirements (such as **ISO standards**), generates actionable tasks, and classifies emails for compliance documentation.  

## 🔍 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Learning Organizational Policies & Security Standards (ISO, Compliance)**  
   - Reads and understands security policies and organizational procedures.  
   - Extracts key action items and maps **responsible roles** (especially SISO/security officers).  

2️⃣ **Processing Emails & Automating Task Creation**  
   - Analyzes email content to **detect regulatory and security topics** (e.g., backups, audits).  
   - Translates requirements into **actionable work processes** based on predefined policies.  
   - Automatically **prioritizes and assigns tasks** based on risk assessment.  

3️⃣ **Classifying & Storing Emails as Evidence (Evidences)**  
   - Detects whether an email contains **compliance-related proof** that must be stored.  
   - Automatically **categorizes and stores** emails into the appropriate compliance folders (A / B / C).  
   - Example: If an email discusses **backup procedures**, it is saved in the **Audit Backup Evidence** folder.
